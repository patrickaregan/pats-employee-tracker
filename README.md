# Pat's Employee Tracker

## Description

  - An employee database and front end you can use to manage departments, roles and employees.
  - Databases are very important to businesses and potential employers and I was motivated to demonstrate my ability to use SQL to create a database and to build a front end to easily manage the data.
  - I wanted to learn how to use the MySQL2 package because it will be used for other projects and in my pprofessional career.
  - This project gives you a low maintenance and easy to use interface to manage a database.
  - I learned how to use MySQL to do Create, Read, Update and Delete operations on any table. I also learned how to use the MySQL2 packate in node to easily work with the database from my code.
